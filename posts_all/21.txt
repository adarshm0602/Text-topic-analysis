//Jejuri Temple in Western Maharashtra
Got to know about Jejuri Temple, Western Maharashtra.  
The architecture is what got my attention, it's definitely unique, built in the 1600s.  
The temple's bells are Portuguese church bells which Baji Rao I got as tribute after the Maratha Victory at Vasai in 1739.

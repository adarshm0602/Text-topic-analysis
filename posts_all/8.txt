//Indian judiciary
In very recent times a series of issues have conspired to create public perception that the Indian judiciary lacks transparency and accountability in dealing with sensitive issues pertaining to itself, the chief among them being judicial corruption. The #JusticeYashwantVarma issue has spawned the  declaration of assets by judicial officers including those of the #SupremeCourt, the abandonment of the practice of simple transfer of errant judges to other courts, the subjection of allegedly corrupt judges to criminal investigations and perhaps even to inquiries by ombudsmen such as the #Lokayukt & the #Lokpal.                                                        There is an equally growing public perception that there is a tendency towards judicial overreach inasmuch as the higher judiciary is encroaching in areas which are the executive’s preserve. In matters pertaining to private law (e.g. where the courts invoked Articles 14 & 21 to strike down unilateral govt arbitration clauses ignoring freedom of contract) the executive could avoid a showdown by prohibiting arbitration where govt was a party except in contracts of low stakes. But the recent 2 judge decision of a Bench of the Supreme Court prescribing a time limit of 3 months for the #PresidentofIndia to dispose off Bills reserved for her assent by the #GovernorofTamilNadu was bound to stir a hornet's nest. It took the irrepressible & Hon’ble #VP of India #JagdeepDhankarji to take up cudgels. While some may question the constitutional propriety of a symbolic second head of the State entering the arena of conflict between 2 limbs of govt, the pointing out of  a patent constitutional flaw (the VP is an accomplished jurist besides) that Article 145(3) of the Constitution mandated that a question pertaining to the interpretation of a Constitutional provision be dealt with by a 5 judge Bench only and that the 2 judge Bench decision was a nullity would surely be in discharge of the Vice President's sworn obligation to uphold the Constitution.

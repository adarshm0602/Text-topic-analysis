// Guru Teg Bahadur Ji
On the auspicious Parkash Purab of Sri Guru Teg Bahadur Ji, I pay my humble tributes to one of the greatest spiritual torchbearers of our land. 
His life epitomises courage and compassionate service. He was unwavering in fighting injustice.
 May his teachings continue to inspire us all in building a society he envisioned.

In an age where data breaches and digital threats are evolving faster than ever, cybersecurity is no longer just an IT concern - it's a business survival strategy.  
Whether you're a startup or an enterprise, your data is one of your most valuable assets. But without the right safeguards, it's also your biggest vulnerability.  

Here's what every organization should prioritize:  
- Multi-factor authentication  
- Regular security audits  
- Employee training on phishing and social engineering  
- Strong data backup and recovery plans  

Remember: Cybersecurity isn't just about technology. It's about mindset.  
Stay aware. Stay protected.

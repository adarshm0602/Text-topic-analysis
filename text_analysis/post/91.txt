# books, reading, library, fiction, weekend
Spent my weekend lost in fiction and coffee.  
Found a quiet spot in the local library.  
Reading helps me disconnect and unwind fully.  
This book had me hooked from page one.  
Iâ€™ve missed this kind of immersive escape.  
Might do this every weekend now.  
Books are my kind of therapy.

# pets, dog, walk, park, fetch
Took my dog for a long walk in the park today.  
He ran around like it was his birthday.  
Played fetch until we were both exhausted.  
Dogs really do live in the moment.  
Made a new pet friend too â€” adorable pup!  
These are the little joys of life.  
Unconditional love on four legs.

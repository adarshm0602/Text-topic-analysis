# coffee, cafe, relaxation
Tried a new café downtown and I’m obsessed.  
The espresso was rich and the ambiance was perfect.  
Sat there journaling while sipping an oat latte.  
Coffee shops really are therapy sometimes.  
Met a stranger who gave me great life advice.  
Nothing beats a quiet morning with good coffee.  
Definitely going back for the vibes alone.

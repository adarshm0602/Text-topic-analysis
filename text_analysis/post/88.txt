# cooking, pasta, tomato, basil, dinner
Tried a new pasta recipe tonight and it SLAPPED.  
Made the sauce from scratch using tomato and garlic.  
Topped it off with fresh basil from my tiny garden.  
I genuinely enjoy cooking when thereâ€™s time to chill.  
This is going in the regular dinner rotation now.  
Even my picky brother asked for seconds.  
Food is love, honestly.

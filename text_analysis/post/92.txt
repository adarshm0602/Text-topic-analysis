# rain, chai, window, cozy, monsoon
Rain tapping on the window never gets old.  
Sipping chai and watching the monsoon roll in.  
The sky looked dramatic and beautiful today.  
Wrapped in a blanket, it felt so cozy.  
Sometimes, the best days are slow ones.  
Nature knows how to set a mood.  
Chai in one hand, peace in the other.

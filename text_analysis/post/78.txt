# fitness, workout, motivation,gym
Dragged myself to the gym today, and it was worth it.  
Leg day is brutal but so satisfying afterward.  
Kept thinking of my goals and stayed focused.  
Fitness is a journey, not a quick fix.  
Also started tracking my macros and steps.  
Workout motivation comes and goes, but showing up matters.  
Feeling stronger each week, even if it's slow.

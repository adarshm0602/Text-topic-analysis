# birthday, cake, balloons, party, surprise
Threw a surprise birthday party for my sister.  
She had no idea and almost cried.  
The room was full of balloons and laughter.  
I baked the cake myself (and it didnâ€™t flop!).  
Family and friends made it so special.  
Parties like this remind me how loved we are.  
Happy memories, captured forever.

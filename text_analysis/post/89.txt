# fitness, gym, cardio, protein, recovery,Focused
Back to the gym grind after a lazy weekend.  
Started with 20 mins of high-intensity cardio.  
Focused on upper body today, arms are toast.  
Refueled with a solid protein smoothie post-workout.  
Recovery is just as important — stretching is key.  
Loving this new fitness routine so far.  
Let’s see if I can stay consistent this time!

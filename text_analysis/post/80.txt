# pets, dog, companionship
Woke up today to my dog cuddling by my feet.  
There’s nothing more comforting than their presence.  
Pets really do become part of the family.  
Took him for a walk and met a bunch of new doggos!  
Dogs have this pure, loyal energy that’s unmatched.  
He’s always waiting by the door when I get home.  
Grateful for this little bundle of joy.

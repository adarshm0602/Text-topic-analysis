//Murti of Shri Ram and Ma Sita
Bharat is such a treasure house of talent!  
This amazingly carved wooden Murti of Shri Ram and Ma Sita was carved by the skilled artisans of coastal Karnataka.  
I love how calm and serene the faces are.  
This Murti is in the Shri Venkataramana temple of #Mulki near Mangaluru.

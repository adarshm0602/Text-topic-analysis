# pets, dog, walk, leash, sunshine
Took my dog for a long walk this morning.  
He gets SO excited when he sees the leash.  
The sunshine today made everything better.  
We even met a few other pets in the park.  
Dogs really do make life brighter.  
Pure joy in a furry little body.  
Canâ€™t wait to go again tomorrow.

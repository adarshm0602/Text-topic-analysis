# books, reading, fiction
Just finished reading *The Midnight Library* and wow.  
Fiction like this really makes you reflect on life.  
I couldn’t put it down once I started.  
Reading has become my go-to escape lately.  
Anyone else love books that blend reality and imagination?  
Thinking of starting a little weekend book club.  
Open to recommendations — drop your favorites!

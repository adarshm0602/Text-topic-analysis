# coding, project, bugs, deadline, compile
Pulled an all-nighter debugging this project.  
The code refused to compile until the last minute.  
Deadlines make me productive (and chaotic).  
Finally fixed the bugs and pushed the update.  
Now it runs like a dream.  
Coding is pain and pleasure in equal parts.  
Need sleep but proud of this one!

# ramen, food, cravings
Late-night cravings hit hard, and I had to make ramen!  
Added some mushrooms, boiled egg, and chili oil.  
Ramen really is comfort food on cold nights.  
Can't beat the warmth and spice of a good bowl.  
Tried a new noodle brand — it was amazing.  
Food cravings are real, y’all. What's your go-to fix?  
Next time, I might throw in some tofu.

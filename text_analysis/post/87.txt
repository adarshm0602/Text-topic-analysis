# travel, adventure, beach, sunrise, photography
Woke up early to catch the sunrise at the coast.  
The beach was so peaceful, barely anyone around.  
Took some amazing photography shots with golden lighting.  
This kind of solo travel really resets the mind.  
Every adventure teaches you something new about yourself.  
Nature really is the best escape.  
More pics coming soon.

# music, books, inspiration, creativity, art
Some days, I live off good music and better books.  
Both spark inspiration in very different ways.  
Reading about artists fuels my own creativity.  
I started sketching again after a long break.  
A new playlist and a novel go hand in hand.  
Music and literature are timeless sources of art.  
Let your creativity breathe today.

# mentalhealth, selfcare, healing,Mental health,care,break
Took a much-needed break from social media this week.  
Sometimes you just need to disconnect to heal.  
Did some journaling, meditated, and focused on rest.  
Mental health should be a priority, not a luxury.  
Self-care isn't selfish â€” it's survival.  
Checking in with myself more often now.  
Hope you're all taking care of your minds too.

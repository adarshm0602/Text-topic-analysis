# Scrambled eggs, breakfast, protein
Started my morning with a high-protein breakfast!  
Scrambled some eggs with a dash of pepper and herbs.  
Topped it with a slice of avocado toast and black coffee.  
Honestly, eggs are the most versatile thing ever.  
Whether boiled or fried, they're always perfect.  
Anyone else here obsessed with breakfast like I am?  
Powering through the day with protein!

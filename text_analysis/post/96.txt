# movie, popcorn, theater, thriller, review
Watched a thriller in the theater tonight.  
Edge-of-the-seat moments and killer plot twists.  
Popcorn in hand, I was fully locked in.  
I might write a full review tomorrow.  
Definitely a movie worth rewatching.  
Cinemas hit different than streaming at home.  
Best night out in a while!

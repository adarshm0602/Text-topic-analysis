# climate, education, youth, protest, awareness
The youth gathered today for a peaceful protest.  
They spoke strongly about climate change and its effects.  
Education on sustainability is more important than ever.  
Placards were raised high, demanding awareness and action.  
It’s powerful to see young voices leading change.  
Climate and education are deeply connected.  
Let’s support this movement for a better future.

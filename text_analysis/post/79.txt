# travel, mountains, adventure,trip
Throwback to my solo trip to the Himalayas!  
The mountains were breathtaking â€” literally and figuratively.  
Hiking through snow-covered trails was surreal.  
Traveling alone taught me so much about myself.  
Adventure is out there if you're willing to chase it.  
Can't wait to go back with friends next time.  
Nature has a way of grounding you.

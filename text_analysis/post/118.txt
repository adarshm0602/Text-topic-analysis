# food, travel, culture, photography, journal
Captured some amazing street food shots during my trip.  
Each dish told a story about local culture.  
Iâ€™m compiling all of it in a food travel journal.  
From spicy curries to sweet delights, it was a feast.  
Photography brings back every flavor and aroma.  
Exploring food and travel together is unmatched.  
This journey filled my heart and belly.

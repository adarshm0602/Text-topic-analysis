//President Trump
Have Learnt enough from President Trump returning into  
Power.  
If President Trump lifted the ladder E up and abandon his  
own country and people upon becoming a 45 Republican  
President, God and people would have not recognized him  
to return into Power again as 47th Republican President  
* I have learnt that, to any position we're you maybe lifted  
by people, we should never try lifting the ladder E up upon  
reaching on top, but leave the ladder E down for those  
willing to use it in climbing, so they also reach on top to  
make your job easier one or other way  
* Regardless of your position, don't ever forget to  
remember where we're coming from and think about  
those young ones who are trying so hard to climb the  
same ladder you used and help them to reach without you  
removing any of a stair on the ladder E trying to make it  
hard for them to reach you.  
We see people change after becoming a Leader when all  
along a person has been so nice, with good heart, kind and  
passionate with others at every stage but wants to change  
ever's neglecting people who tried and labored hard to  
push the ladder E up.  
President Donald Trump refuses, I am not famous person  
but Jesus Christ is more famous, because I also look up  
to God.  
The President is still making promises, I will labour for you  
not because you love me but because God loves our  
country, it's like God has shown favor to our country
